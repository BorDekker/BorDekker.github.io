            <h2>
                What is this game about?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Dome Defenders is a game that we developed in the 4th period of my first year for a project called Project Space. 
                For this project we were going to make a game based around the theme space, this was a project that lasted over a period of 8 weeks.
                Our idea of the game was that you crashed on a moon when you got struck by a meteorite, you were being followed by aliens for your intel on them.
                <br><br>
                On the moon you crashed, you've build a base to protect yourself and the resources you're gathering from the moon.
                But while your gathering resources, you're being attacked by aliens and meteor showers. 
                You have to get inside your base and use your gun to desstroy the aliens and meteorites to defend your base.
                <br><br>
                This was made with Unity, C# and Github. We worked on this game with 5 people, 3 artists and 2 programmers.

            <h2>
                My role
            </h2>
            <p>
                My role was making and programming the menu, inventory, pausing the game & implementing art into the game.

            <p>
                Creating the menu was fun and challenging since it was the first time I created a menu for a game.
                <br>
                I used my own knowledge and the internet to create the menu, creating the inventory and pause 
                <br>
                menu was challenging at first. But since they're both similar in code, it was useful to use the same 
                <br>
                code for different mechanics.

                        In Unity there is something called SceneManager,
                        <br> 
                        in this you can place all your levels of your game.
                        <br>
                        The menu is 0 in the SceneManager, the game is 1.
                        <br>
                        When you press play in the menu, in the SceneManager
                        <br> 
                        it will get a + 1. In doing so it transitions you to the game 
                        <br>
                        from the menu.

                        When you press the key button "escape",
                        <br>
                        the time in the game will become 0. 
                        <br>
                        The menu will slowly reveal itself,
                        <br>
                        you can press the menu button to go back to the menu.
                        <br>
                        When you press resume, time will become 1.
                        <br>
                        Now the game will resume from the moment it paused.
