                What is this project about?
            </h2>
            <p>
                This project is about learning houdini and getting used to the layout and getting back in touch with it since my last project No Noise.
                This time I saw a cool effect in Arcane season 2 where there was this sphere that look all lovecraftian and magical.
                So I decided to try re-create that in Houdini with the help of an abstract tutorial from Houdini self on their website.

                Recreating the wild rune from Arcane season 2

                I looked at the movement & color from the reference to get an idea how this would look in my final product.
                So I with the help of Houdini's own tutorial I remembered how the program worked and got used to the layout & how to move the camera.
                Then I started by adding a circle to my scene, since the base form of the wild rune is a sphere.

            </div>
            <p class="flexP">
                I then added a transform node to scale down the Y to 0.5, giving it a squished sphere look.
                Then I added a scatter node which would replace my sphere with a sphere form of points.
                Then adding a line node and combining that with the scatter node would put a line on all my points of the sphere.

            </div>
            <p class="flexP">
                By adding a group expression node it creates points at the bottom of the line.
                Then I added a vellum hair node so that all the lines had points above the bottom.
                With the help of another node I can create them to be like hair.

            </div>
            <p class="flexP">
                I then added a vellum solver which made all the lines like hair.
                Connecting the vellum solver to the connect adjacent pieces node would add more points creating more hair.
                Then I added the attribute blur which would make the hair blurry and compresses it into a round shape.
                As the final step of creating this simulation I added color to the effect, using multiple colors to make it look as close to the wild rune as possible.

                I then created a network in which I imported my scene and added a background color.
                Then I added a camera & render settings, creating the final product you see in the video above.

                Retrospective
            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                This project was a lot of fun, I love creating simulations from stuff I love such as Arcane.
                Although I did have some trouble with rendering the video.
                I didn't know you were not able to render out an mp4 on your laptop on the free version of Houdini.
                So I decided to render it out in MPlay and then record my screen to get the footage.
                <br><br>
                The tutorial from Houdini helped out alot, since I always have difficulty trying to see in my head how something could be done.
                But I'm getting better at it, so long as I make simulations, fx ect from movies, series and more.
                Houdini is a difficult program to learn, but the results you get are amazing! 
                Can't wait see to what I'll make with it in the future.
