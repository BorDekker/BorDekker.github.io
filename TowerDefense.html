            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                Tower Defense is a game project I've developed in the first period of my second year called Project Tower Defense.
                In this project, every developer would develop a Tower Defense game by themselves. 
                I wanted my Tower Defense to look interseting and a bit more special then the other ones, so I decided to use Aseprite to make a pixel Tower Defense. 
                <br><br>
                Monsters waddle about destroying the world and devouring its inhabitants, you as the hero must make use of magic to defend the roads and citizens of this Kingdom.
                You have multiple types of towers at your disposal, towers which will upgrade over time as it kills more enemies. 
                You as the hero can fly around the map to defend the roads at mutiple places, prepare yourself as something big is coming... 
                <br><br>
                This game was made with C#, Unity, Aseprite and Github.
                <br><br>
                Game code made by Bor Dekker.
                <br>
                Pixel art made by Bor Dekker.
                <br><br>
                Project duration: 8 weeks, working on it every day besides weekend.
                <br><br>

                Creating a game in 8 weeks was a very fun and challenging task to do, creating multiple functions & mechanics to create my game.
                I first started small, creating 2D towers in Unity that can kill enemies and a function that can spawn enemies.
                <br><br>
                Slowly I did biger To Do's such as creating a wave system for enemies to spawn in between and placing towers with money. 
                After I've created a small tower defense game with the basic mechanics, I started creating art and thinking of 2 unique mechanics.
                <br><br>
                I came up with 2 major unique mechanics, a hero you can move around with your mouse & towers that will upgrade themselves the more enemies they kill.

                Retrospective
            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                I loved the development of making a video game, looking weird and small in the beginning.
                But slowly looking better and everything combining with eachother.
                <br><br>
                This was an excellent way to show how game development goes, I learned a lot from this.
                For example, I've learned that designing and creating the world, enemies, hero with pixel art is a lot of fun. 
                But that it also does take a lot of time and effort to create this world.
