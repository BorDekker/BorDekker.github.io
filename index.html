                    <p>
                        I'm Bor Dekker, I am an Unreal Engine 5 generalist, I specialize working in Unreal Engine 5, Unreal Engine Sequencer, Blueprints and I would like to get work & get experience with MetaHuman, Houdini, Blender and more!
                        I'm born and living in the Netherlands with my family, I am 20 years old.
                        <br><br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading books / manga, watching movies / anime, watching devlogs on YouTube, programming and making small movies in Unreal Engine. 
                        By programming my own projects & making my own films I can improve myself, my knowledge & skills.
                        <br><br>
                        I grew up with the Lego games, such as Lego Dimensions, Lego Marvel Avengers, Lego Star Wars and of course Minecraft as well. When I became older, I wanted to play games that were more realistic and good looking graphics. 
                        Games like Call of Duty Black Ops, Jurassic World Evolution, Star Wars Battlefront and Batman Akrham Knight. 
                        But in 2018 a game came out that was my number one game for 3 years. 
                        That game was God Of War, it was the first game where I was fully immersed in it's story, gameplay, environment and music.
                        <br><br>
                        Thanks to God of War, I was more focused on story, gameplay, design, music and environment. 
                        Because of God of War, I got in touch with Dark Souls and thanks to that with Bloodborne which became my number one game. 
                        As of this moment I am playing a new souls game called Lies Of P, a horror game called Scorn and a horror game called Layers of Fear Remastered. 
                        These 3 games are all made with Unreal Engine 5 and it's stunning of what you can achieve with Unreal Engine 5.

                                    <br>
                                    So that I can be versatile when it comes to the game industry & film industry. 
                                    Learning all these skills will inevitably help me with learning other software and it makes me more open to multiple jobs instead of being solely a programmer.
                                    Plus I can create more amazing projects in a shorter time with making short animated films instead of trying to make a game in 2 years for example.

                                    I'm learning Metahuman Creator to create high quality digital humans that I can use for my projects.
                                    <br>
                                    I'm learning Metahuman Animator to animate my Metahumans for my projects.

                                    I'm learning how to make a cinematic film by modeling, animating and using camera work in Unreal Engine.

                                <li><span>Blender & Houdini</span>

                                    I'm learning Blender so that I can learn how to create special 3D models for my projects, instead of being dependent on Sketchfab & Mixamo.
                                    <br>
                                    I'm learning Houdini so that I can create complex effects, animations or simulations that can be easily modified.
