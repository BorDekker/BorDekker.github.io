                    <p>
                        I'm Bor Dekker, I am an Unreal Engine 5 game developer, I specialize working in Unreal Engine 5, Blueprints, C++ and I would like to get work & get experience with MetaHuman.
                        I'm born and living in the Netherlands with my family, I am 19 years old. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading books / manga, watching movies / anime, watching devlogs on YouTube and programming. 
                        I'm also programming for my own projects so that I can improve myself, my knowledge & skills.
                        <br><br>
                        I grew up with the Lego games, such as Lego Dimensions, Lego Marvel Avengers, Lego Star Wars and of course Minecraft as well. When I became older, I wanted to play games that were more realistic and good looking graphics. 
                        Games like Call of Duty Black Ops, Jurassic World Evolution, Star Wars Battlefront and Batman Akrham Knight. 
                        But in 2018 a game came out that was my number one game for 3 years. 
                        That game was God Of War, it was the first game where I was fully immersed in it's story, gameplay, environment and music.
                        <br><br>
                        Thanks to God of War, I was more focused on story, gameplay, design, music and environment. 
                        Because of God of War, I got in touch with Dark Souls and thanks to that with Bloodborne which became my number one game. 
                        As of this moment I am playing a new souls game called Lies Of P, Lords Of The Fallen and a horror game called Layers of Fear Remastered. 
                        These 3 games are all made with Unreal Engine 5 and it's stunning of what you can achieve with Unreal Engine 5.
