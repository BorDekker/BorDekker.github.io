                In the second period of my second year, we had a project called vertical slice. In this project, you and your team would recreate a game that was made by a company.
                We had 2 levels of games, easy and expert. In the video's below, you can see which games you could choose out of. My team and I chose Carto, because none of our artists could do 3D.
                Our team consisted of 3 developers and 5 artists, together we tried our best to recreate the game Carto.

                Creating a game in 8 weeks was a very fun and challenging task to do, creating multiple functions & mechanics to create my game.
                I first started small, creating 2D towers in Unity that can kill enemies and a function that can spawn enemies.
                <br><br>
                Slowly I did biger To Do's such as creating a wave system for enemies to spawn in between and placing towers with money. 
                After I've created a small tower defense game with the basic mechanics, I started creating art and thinking of 2 unique mechanics.
                <br><br>
                I came up with 2 major unique mechanics, a hero you can move around with your mouse & towers that will upgrade themselves the more enemies they kill.

                Retrospective
            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                I loved the development of making a video game, looking weird and small in the beginning.
                But slowly looking better and everything combining with eachother.
                <br><br>
                This was an excellent way to show how game development goes, I learned a lot from this.
                For example, I've learned that designing and creating the world, enemies, hero with pixel art is a lot of fun. 
                But that it also does take a lot of time and effort to create this world.
