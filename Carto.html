                In the second period of my second year, we had a project called vertical slice. In this project, you and your team would recreate a game that was made by a company.
                We had 2 difficulty's of games, easy and expert. My team and I chose Carto from easy, because none of our artists could do 3D.
                Our team consisted of 3 developers and 5 artists, together we tried our best to recreate the game Carto.
                <br><br>
                Project date: From November 2022 - February 2023 
                <br><br>
                Project duration: 10 weeks, 2 1/2 day each week.
                In the link below, we have the gameplay of our Carto.
                <br>
                In the link below that, we have Carto of Sunhead Games that we tried to recreate.

                My role & contribution to this project
            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                My role was making movement for the player, implement art & animations.
                <br>
                And lastly create an AI that walks around an certain area.

                    <figcaption>
                        This is where I place which animation the characters play, I did this for the mother with baby & kid running around.

            <p class="flexP">
                I made the movement of the player first making a Vector 3D velocity, the reason why is because this was a 3D game. 
                We did this for our camera angle, after figuring out that in 2D it wouldn't work.
                After that I made a float, which would define our movement speed for the player.
                I made an animator, in our update I'm setting the animator to 0 speed.
                <br><br>
                When I'm pressing either W, A, S, or D. It will change its location towards a direction x movement speed x Time.DeltaTime.
                Time.DeltaTime is the amount of seconds it took for the engine to process the previous frame.
                After that, it will change the animation speed from 0 to the movement speed. 
                It will also change animations from idle animation to walking animation.

            <p class="flexP">
                I first made a index for waypoints, these points are where the AI kid can go to when it's finished going to another point.
                Then I setted its movement speed, after that I placed in the void Start that when the game starts. 
                The waypoint index will be equal to an random number between 0 and 12.
                I'm then setting the transform position equal to the location of the waypoint index.
                <br><br>
                In the update I'm setting transform position equal to an Vector3.MoveTowards, what this does is that the AI kid will go towards the transform position of a waypoint.
                I then made an If statement, when you arrive at an waypoint transform position.
                AI kid will choose a random number between 0 and 12, then it will move towards a new waypoint transform position.
                When AI kid reaches that position, it will choose a new random number.
                This is how he walks around while playing his animation.

            <h2>
                Retrospective
            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                This was an interesting project, recreating a game that already existed was quite challenging.
                Though using the game as reference to check if the art style was made correctly, check if character & player speed matches with the game.
                <br><br>
                Although we didn't manage to finish this game, I'd say that so far everything looks good.
                We sadly had a lot of bumps in our development, but we still managed to make a decent recreation of Carto.
                I learned something about making an AI which was cool & I've also learned how to implement animations into Unity.
