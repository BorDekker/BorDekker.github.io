            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                Bon Appmobile is an Unreal Engine 5 VR game project developed in the 4th period of my second year. 
                In this project our group would make a game where you have to deliver something from point A to point B inside a vehicle.
                Our idea was that you'd create pizza's inside the vehicle while driving around the map to deliver them at houses. 
                You can use ingredients to make the vehicle go faster or slow down, there is also a steering wheel.
                With it you can go left, right or straight at intersections. As for our art style, we chose to do it in a cartoon based art style.
                <br><br>
                Project date: From May 2023 - July 2023 
                <br><br>
                Project duration: 10 weeks, 3 days in each week.
                <br><br>
                Development Team: 15+ people.
                <br><br>
                In the link below, we have a gameplay video of our project.

                My role & contribution in this project.
            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                I was in the environment sub-team, my role was to implement art into our project.
                <br>
                I've also implemented a spline function all around the world and a fence function.

                A spline is a linear line with two ends, called points.
                It is on this spline that you are riding on and having the option to choose between which direction you'd want.
                The different colours in the gif above for the splines mean that those are all the different routes you can take, with the red spline being the main spline.
                I have also implemented 3 bridges around the map to crossover and placed fences at every village.

                I've made a Blueprint function where you can drag a spline and it will randomize the 2 fence assets that are in the Blueprint.
                We did this so that there was some variation in the fence, instead of it being the same fence everywhere.
                <br><br>
                I have made this using Blueprints, first it's getting both the fence meshes. After that it's getting the bounding box of the placed mesh, breaks the box into min & max vector.
                Then we get the X, Y and Z vector, we then have an offset float which is 5. We then do X vector + the offset to get it in our spacing float.
                Then I'm getting our spline length to divide it by the spacing, of which will floor it to get the number of instances.
                <br><br>
                Then I'm creating a For Loop, in this For Loop I'm getting our location and the location of our newly spawned fence.
                After that I made a branch, the branch will randomly choose 1 or 2. if it's true it will instance a fence, if it's false it will instance the other fence.
                it will also make sure that the instanced meshes are standing correctly by getting it's location and rotation.
                <br><br>
                In the link below, you can see a video of the blueprint of the fence spline.

            <h2>
                Retrospective
            </h2>
            <p class="flexP">
                This was a cool project, seeing that our world at first is nothing but grey boxes.
                But then in the end looking so beautiful and colourful, I'm not that big of a fan for VR games.
                But this was a lot of fun making and playing, the ones who play tested this game at the end of our project loved it.
                <br><br>
                I've also learned that even things that aren't fun to do are necessary for a good game, such as placing down the splines.
                it took a lot of time for me to place them all down, even more time when they're were changes. 
                But I would do it all over again to achieve making a game like this.
